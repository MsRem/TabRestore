  <h1>Privacy Policy for Tab Restore</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the Chrome extension <strong>Tab Restore</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "the Extension") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including your browsing history—even though it requests permission to access it solely for restoring tabs locally. All data processed by the Extension remains on your local device and is used exclusively to support its core functionality: restoring and managing your browser tabs.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension requests only the minimum required permissions to function, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>tabs</code> – to read and reopen browser tabs</li>
    <li><code>sessions</code> – to restore recently closed tabs or windows</li>
    <li><code>storage</code> – to store local settings or preferences (if any)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These permissions are strictly limited to on-device use and are never used to collect or analyze user data.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does not transmit or store any user data externally. All operations occur locally within your browser. We do not share, sell, or disclose any user data to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics platforms. It operates independently without relying on external APIs.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Since no personal data is collected, users do not need to request access, correction, or deletion of their data. If you have any questions or concerns, you are encouraged to contact us.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Policy Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, along with the updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
